**Part 1**

1. AIOps vs MLOps
   AIOps is an entirely different topic referring to the process of solving operational challenges
   through the use of artificial intelli‐gence (i.e., AI for DevOps). An example for the same would be 
   a caution for a network security failure alerting the DevOps about the possible problems beforehand.





2. Interpretable Linear Regression Model
    Interpretability is the degree to which a human can consistently predict the model's result. 
    The higher the interpretability of a machine learning model, the easier it is for someone to comprehend why certain decisions or predictions have been made.
    As the linear regression model forces the prediction to be a linear combination of features, the biases and the correction are easily understandable to humans resulting in it  being a interpretable model. In short, linearity leads to the interpretable model.
